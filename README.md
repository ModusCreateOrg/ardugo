# ArduGo
ArduGo is an implementation of a goban for the Arduboy game console.

You make the first play by moving the cursor with the arrow keys and pressing the "A"  button to place a black stone on the board.

The game will respond by placing a white stone on the board and then it is your turn again. You continue to alternate turns until one player wins.

Pressing the "B" button restarts the game.

# Automated Testing

The automated test suite, written in Python, is used to test the application on the ArduBoy using the serial port.
